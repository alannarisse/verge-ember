		<em>Articulated Talismans: Ooh-Pap-A-Da</em><br>
		February 2018<br>
		5128 N Albina, Portland OR, 97217
	</p>

<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<p>My work, in general, is an investigation into the personal coded structures of perception.  Recently I have been interested in primitive talismans that are used to mark the cyclical nature of life.  In the ephemera of what one leaves behind.  I also like jazz, birds, orange soda and comic books. I investigate issues of abstraction, improvisation, and an audience’s engagement in a work.  I like to make bodies of work that initiate a positive and inquisitive response in a viewer.  I am striving to create a viewing experience that is meditative, irreverent, gestural, honest, mysterious, organic, and open.</p>

<p>This is in tribute, in part, to Babs Gonzales who in 1947 recorded a the song Ooh-Pap-A-Da for Blue Note Records with his group Three Bips and a Bop.  Dizzy Gillespie made the song famous years later.  The song is said to be an early prototype of vocalese style in which the singer would use lyrical lines instead of relying only of onomatopoeic scatting lines as was popular among vocalists at the time.  Also Jack Whitten recently died and I really liked his art a lot so in some capacity this is also a tribute to him too.  </p>

<p>This body of work is taken from a daily practice of drawing.  The forms have become a repetitive process, a warm up exercise.  They are then liberated from the tyranny of rectangular paper only to be attached with paper fasteners to other wayward and lost pieces thus finding their own formal meaning together.  Once the pieces have spent a bit of time getting to work as one they are mounted within an ikea frame as a way to preserve the perfection of their arrangement.  Like taxidermied birds that can’t fly anymore cause that are in a glass box and dead.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think about mystics. </p>

<p>All pieces are $150 a piece. </p>

<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<p>A•C•M• Lorish presents some new paintings about the mystical forces that dictate our lives without ever fully revealing their intentions. They are also formally about interactions of color. They are also about locations that don't exist on this plain of existence. They are also about love and sex and jazz and food. They are also sort of about me. They are also probably about you.</p>

	<h3>Solfatara: Paintings Celebrating Demons and Other Things</h3>

	<blockquote>The demonic life of a lover is like the surface of a solfatara; huge bubbles (muddy and scorching) burst, one after the other; when one falls back and dies out, returning to the mass, another forms and swells further on.<br><br>-Roland Barthes</blockquote>



	<p>Taken from a short section of Roland Barthes A Lovers Discourse these six paintings celebrate, with glitter puff paint, the demons that hide in the recesses and shadows, always lurking and waiting.  The other paintings are abstracted structures, layered with syncopated marks, meant to create order and calm acting as a way to foil or control the demons. </p>
