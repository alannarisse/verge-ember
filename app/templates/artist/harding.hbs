  <h3>Biography</h3>
  <p>Bryn Harding was born and raised in Oregon. He attended Hamline University in St. Paul, MN from 2006-2010 and later earned an MFA in Printmedia at the Pacific Northwest College of Art in 2017. He is currently living and working in Portland.</p>


  <h3>Statement</h3>
  <p>Places I Have (never) Been is a reflection on the time I have spent driving on freeways and highways. The paintings, photographs, and writings that make up this show were all collected on a series of road trips during the summer of 2016 in Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona and Montana.</p>

  <p>These images explore roads as a technology that simultaneously grant us access to, and alienate us from, landscapes and place. In a larger sense this is true of how all technology functionsâ€“connecting, while also separating us from our reality. On a personal level, the images also explore questions about identity and self. I often feel at home and like myself on the road, when I am between places or visiting somewhere new, than when I am in a place that has shaped me. Traveling across the West by car is a quintessentially American experience and the questions raised, about the relationships between technologies, identity, self and place can only be honestly answered by embracing contradiction.

      <p>I am singing along, but<br>
      the stereo is blaring, and<br>
      I don't hear my own voice anymore</p>

      <p>In an air conditioned box<br>
      flying down sunbaked blacktop<br>
      across high desert. I wonder:<br>
      "Is this how the West was won?"
