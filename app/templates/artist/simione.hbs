			<h3>Artist's Statement:</h3>
			<p>Within the trauma of the redacted document, a new context presents itselfâ€¦ a context in which loss, experienced by the Other, may be felt and understood. Using methods of erasure to create my own "redacted" documents, I make metaphors for the experiences of loss. I present fragments, tiny bits of evidence, allusions to a lost history. It is a poetry born of violence, and it is this violence with which my practice is concerned. What remains, in spite of secrecy, is a new document. A new identity has been constructed. A site of new hope emerges where understanding may be possible.</p>
