<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<p>The alchemists believed in transmutation: changing a thing from one state into another, higher form. This transmutative elevation is achieved through color and chemical action. This cycle of photographs, entitled Alchemy was created by directly exposing photographic paper with light and chemicals. These basic elements, actually the invisible tools of analogue photography, are made here into the tangible photographic subject itself. Taking the camera away from photography doesnâ€™t remove the possibility for an image, instead it provides space for proposing images for an un-lensed, visual world. You are invited to engage in an unconventional relationship with photography, to surrender preconceived notions of what a photograph is, must or can be. This work is not a representation of something else in the world, it is that something else in the world.</p>
