				<h3>Lost &amp; Found</h3>

				<p>Using found photographs re-processed through digital manipulation and her signature stitching technique, Ehren Reed’s work examines the value we place on memory in the current digital environment. Her most recent work employs photographs pulled from yearbooks and photo albums discovered at thrift stores— once keepsakes to treasure, now cast aside and forgotten. The embroidery she employs in her work bears the implicit touch of the human hand as she manipulates these with the effect of bringing a new and distinct physicality to tossed-away images.</p>
