<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<p>Art has always been a medium I have felt deeply about but the more serious choice of taking art professionally happened two years ago when I moved to USA from India. My art is my exploration of the consciousness and its place in the universe. My ideas are essentially rooted in The Upanishads, the great book of Indian wisdom composed thousands of years ago. Through patterns and figurative I try to simplify the microcosm in the macrocosm.</p>
